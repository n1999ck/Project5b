### Elements I liked about using Scala
1. Once I got used to the syntax, I felt that it was cleaner than Java's.
2. I liked the shortcuts Scala provides for classes, like making a constructor in the class definition.
3. After spending a little time writing it, I found Scala easier to get used to than any of the other languages we've covered.

### Elements I disliked about using Scala
1. I really disliked Scala's documentation. It was so technical and academic that I could hardly read it. Since Java's documentation is my golden standard, I was surprised at how unhelpful I found Scala's.
2. Some syntax felt unnecessarily strange. Defining a variable's type seems out of order to me for example.
3. It was a pain to start using Scala while it's essentially between versions. Every time I looked something up I had the extra complication of remembering which weird syntax I was using.
